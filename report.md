TITLE:GEO-FENCING APP


ABSTRACT:

 A geo-fence is a virtual boundary for a realworld geographic area. A geo-fence can be generated as per user’s need by considering different radius, or a geo-fence can be a predefined set of boundaries. Geo-fencing is use of geo-fence. Geo fencing is a feature that uses the global positioning system (GPS) to define geographical boundaries. It has widely increasing scope. Very few applications are dealing with geo-notifications that are intended to inform the mobile/stationary user proactively about locationspecific information. The technology behind proactive location-based services is called Geo-fencing.


INTRODUCTION:

Geo-fencing (geo-fencing) is a feature in a software application/program that uses the global positioning system (GPS) or radio frequency identification (RFID) to define geographical boundaries.[1] A geo-fence is a virtual barrier. Geo-fence apps and tools monitor when mobile devices or other physical objects enter or exit an established geo-fenced area and provide administrators with alerts or notifications when there’s a change in status for a device. These alerts can be in form of text messages, e-mail notifications, phone calls or similar means of communication. Geo-fencing is executed on the mobile devices. It includes the continuous positioning of the mobile device as well as the continuous matching of the mobile’s position with a set of geo-fences. The mobile device is considered to be a client that is mainly responsible to locate itself whereas the continuous comparison of the mobile’s position with a large set of dedicated zones, called geo-fences. Geonotification plays very important role in geo-fencing. Generally the geo-fencing refers to the idea in which the user defines the boundaries virtually over a geographical area, and once the transition is detected over a boundary the notification is send to performed the desired action .The paper is organized in following sections 1.location based services, 2.geofencing, 3.working, 4.applications.



Geo-fencing
 Geo-fencing combines awareness of the user's current location with awareness of the user's proximity to locations that may be of interest. To mark a exact location, it should specify its latitude and longitude. To adjust the proximity for the location, it should add a radius. The latitude, longitude, and radius define a geo-fence, creating a circular area, or fence, around the location of interest.
Geo-fencing is executed on the mobile devices. It includes the continuous positioning and/or tracking of the mobile device as well as the continuous matching of the mobile device’s position with a set of virtual boundary i.e. geofences. Geo-fence can be circular or polygonal geo-fence. As shown in Fig. [1][2]. The mobile device is considered to be a client that is mainly responsible to locate itself and the continuously comparison of the mobile’s position with a large set of geo-fences. Geo-fencing is mainly the use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite network and/or local radiofrequency identifiers (RFID such as Wi-Fi nodes or Bluetooth beacons)[7] to create geo-fence i.e. virtual boundaries around a location in map. Geo-fencing uses GPS coordinates to encapsulate a geographic area and takes a mobile user’s (who has opted in to receive push notifications)[8] location data via GPS to determine his/her proximity to that particular region (whether mobile user inside geo-fence or outside geofence or if mobile user just went in and came out of that particular area in a matter of seconds). Example is shown in Fig-[3] 

Elements in Geo-fencing SystemGPS –
 GPS can improve location accuracy to within 5 meters of mobile user’s location and is easily available with no extra burden on carrier infrastructure. A-GPS – Assisted GPS (A-GPS) supplements GPS satellite information with surveyed coordinates of cell/mobile tower sites to enable more precise server-based calculation of device position. Cell-ID(COO/CID) – Device is located by identifying the network cell tower to which it is connected. CID positioning is simple, and can be done on the network or on the mobile user device and does not require upgrades to network location infrastructure or mobile devices. CID provides a very rapid response time.[14] Wi-Fi – Wi-Fi reduces time-to-first-fix (TTFF) and is appropriate for indoor environments that obstruct satellite signals. Wi-Fi is also a viable option for outdoor positioning with the large availability of access points in urban areas. Enterprises can benefit by using existing investments in Wi-Fi networks as location infrastructure.


Types of Geo-notification
- (1) Static geo-notification: This is based on the geographical position of a mobile user with respect to a fixed area. For Example, notification is send to particular mobile user when he entered into geo-fence, for example student enter into school campus.[10] 
(2) Dynamic geo-notification: This is based on the geographical position of a mobile user with respect to a changing data stream. For example, the “open parking space” notification that is sent to mobile users who happen to be driving nearby. 
(3) Peer-to-Peer geo-notification: This is based on the geographical position of a mobile user with respect to other users. For example, go through notification of nearby friends on a social mobile app like Facebook, or Foursquare. 

 HOW IT WORKS
 GPS satellites circle the earth twice a day in a very precise orbit and transmit signal information to earth. GPS receivers take this information and use trilateration to calculate the user's exact location. Essentially, the GPS receiver compares the time a signal was transmitted by a satellite with the time it was received. The time difference tells the GPS receiver how far away the satellite is. Now, with distance measurements from a few more satellites, the receiver can determine the user's position and display it on the unit's electronic map.[18].  
                                               
     A GPS receiver must be in coverage of the signal of at least 3 satellites to calculate a 2-D position (latitude and longitude) and track movement. With four or more satellites in coverage, the receiver can determine the user's 3-D position (latitude, longitude and altitude). Once the user's position has been determined, the GPS unit can calculate other information, such as speed, bearing, track, trip distance, distance to destination, sunrise and sunset time and more.  

     The 24 satellites that make up the GPS space segment are orbiting the earth about 12,000 miles/ 20000 km above us. They are constantly moving, making two complete orbits in less than 24 hours. These satellites are travelling at speeds of roughly 7,000 miles an hour.

    GPS satellites are powered by solar energy. They have backup batteries on-board to keep them running in the event of a solar eclipse, when there's no solar power. Small rocket boosters on each satellite keep them flying in the correct path. 
   Theoretically, there are no limits on the size of your geofence, but in the interests of maintaining accuracy we recommend a minimum radius of 10 meters and a maximum radius of 200 kilometers. 

           
       
 APPLICATION
 -Geo-fencing, used with child safety, if child enter or leaves designated area then parent can get notification.
 -Fleet management- When a truck driver breaks from his route, the dispatcher receives an alert. 
-In Shopping tracker, user can get notification about shopping reminder for example Shopping list notification when user will be near to shopping location.
 -In Marine safety service, if ship will moving towards restricted area or international border then before some predefined distance notification will be send to ship.
 -Human resource management- An employee smart card or GPS tracking device will send an alert to security if an employee attempts to enter an unauthorized geofence/area.
 -Compliance management- Network logs record geo-fence crossings to document the proper use of devices and their compliance with established rules.
 -Marketing- A restaurant can send a notification or a text message with the day's specials to an opt-in customer when the customer enters a defined geographical area or geo-fence.
 -Asset management- An RFID tag on a pallet can send an alert if the pallet is removed from the warehouse without authorization. [16].
 -Law enforcement- An ankle bracelet can send notification or alert authorities if an individual under house arrest leaves the premises.
CONCLUSION:

The geo-fencing technology provides simplified solution to all kinds of proximity and buffer analyses. It can be used for all mapped objects existed in charts vector data sets, both static and dynamic. It takes a major step from a mobile based towards an infrastructure-based Geo-fencing system. Mobile clients were designed which adjust their location update strategies to the recommendations of the infrastructure as well as to the different activities of the mobile client user.
